You are a senior full-stack engineer building a production-ready TODO application.

GOAL:
Create a complete TODO application with frontend, backend, and database using Supabase. 
The app must support authentication (login, signup, logout), secure data access, and real-world best practices.

TECH STACK:
- Frontend: React (with modern hooks), Vite or Next.js
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (clean, responsive UI)
- Backend: Node.js + Express OR Next.js API routes
- Database & Auth: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Supabase Auth)
- State management: React Context or lightweight store
- Environment variables for secrets

CORE FEATURES:
1. Authentication
   - User signup with email & password
   - User login
   - User logout
   - Session persistence
   - Protected routes (unauthenticated users cannot access TODOs)

2. TODO Features
   - Create a new todo
   - Read all todos for the logged-in user
   - Update todo (title, completed status)
   - Delete todo
   - Mark todo as completed / pending
   - Todos must be user-specific (no cross-user access)

3. Database (Supabase)
   - Create a `todos` table with:
     - id (uuid, primary key)
     - user_id (foreign key linked to auth.users)
     - title (text)
     - is_completed (boolean)
     - created_at (timestamp)
   - Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
   - Policies:
     - Users can only read their own todos
     - Users can only create/update/delete their own todos

4. Backend API
   - REST endpoints:
     - POST /todos
     - GET /todos
     - PUT /todos/:id
     - DELETE /todos/:id
   - Validate requests
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Secure Supabase service role usage (if required)

5. Frontend UI
   - Login page
   - Signup page
   - Todo dashboard
   - Logout button
   - Loading states & error messages
   - Mobile-responsive design

6. Production-Level Practices
   - Clean folder structure
   - Reusable components
   - Environment variable usage (.env)
   - Proper error handling
   - Comments explaining important logic
   - No hard-coded secrets
   - Optimized API calls

DELIVERABLES:
- Frontend code
- Backend code
- Supabase SQL schema
- Supabase RLS policies
- Instructions to run locally
- Explanation of how auth, database, and API work together

IMPORTANT:
Treat this like a real SaaS-grade TODO app.
Code should be clean, scalable, and production-ready.
